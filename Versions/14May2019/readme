The original ARBitrator described in Heller et al. 2014 is in
../2014_original/ARBitrator_1.0.zip.  The zip file includes instructions for the
original ARBitrator which you may find helpful.  However, please use the updated
ARBitrator software.

The updated ARBitrator in ARBitrator.14May2019.tgz adapts to NCBI changes since
2014, mainly the switch from GI’s to accessions and from “http” to “https”.  There
is a README in the tgz that describes how to run the updated ARBitrator via some
provided shell scripts.
