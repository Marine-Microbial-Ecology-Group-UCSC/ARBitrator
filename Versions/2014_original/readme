This is Phil Heller's original ARBitrator distribution.  The underlying source
code, modified to keep pace with NCBI changes, is available in the GitHub repo
under Build_ARBitrator/Workdir/arbitrator.  Please run only the most recent
version of ARBitrator.

Newer versions of ARBitrator include a README which describes how to run
ARBitrator using the script runARBitrator.sh.  Original ARBitrator was run by
invoking 'java' as described in the 2014 paper and in
ARBitratorInstructions.docx in ARBitrator_1.0.zip.
