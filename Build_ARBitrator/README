If you want to make a new ARBitrator distribution (and have already installed
the Java Development kit**), then do the following in a unix shell:
  cd Workdir
  ../scripts/makeARBitrator.sh date_or_description

This will create ARBitrator.date_or_description.tgz which includes everything a
user needs to run ARBitrator, including a README which describes how to run the
wrapper script runARBitrator.sh


**makeARBitrator.sh requres the Java compiler (javac) and archiver (jar) which
  are both included in the Java Development Kit (JDK).
