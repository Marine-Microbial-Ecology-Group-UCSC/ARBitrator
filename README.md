# ARBitrator

ARBitrator is a semi-automatic pipeline for retrieving and quality-filtering _nifH_ genes in GenBank.  It was created by [Philip Heller](https://www.sjsu.edu/people/philip.heller) (Heller et al., 2014; https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btu417) during his PhD in the [Zehr Lab at UC Santa Cruz](https://www.jzehrlab.com). Since then small modifications have been made to accomodate changes on the NCBI side including the retirement of GI numbers, requiring HTTPS, and faster query rates when using API keys.  Functionally the lastest ARBitrator is the same as the original.

Most likely you want to run ARBitrator. Please use *[ARBitrator.31Mar2022.tgz](Versions/31Mar2022/ARBitrator.31Mar2022.tgz)* which is the most recent version.  Always the previous sentence will link to the most recent version. (Older versions are available in this repository but are no longer compatible with NCBI requirements.)

If instead you want to examine/modify the source code or build your own ARBitrator, then please clone the repository and see [Build_ARBitrator/README](Build_ARBitrator/README).
