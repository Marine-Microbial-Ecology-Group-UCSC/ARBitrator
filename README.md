# ARBitrator

ARBitrator is a semi-automatic pipeline for retrieving and quality-filtering _nifH_ genes in GenBank.  It was created by Philip Heller (Heller et al., 2014; https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btu417). Since then small modifications have been made to accomodate changes on the NCBI side including the retirement of GI numbers, requiring HTTPS, and faster query rates when using API keys.  Functionally the lastest ARBitrator is the same as the original.

Most likely you want to run ARBitrator. Please use *[ARBitrator.31Mar2022.tgz](Versions/31Mar2022/ARBitrator.31Mar2022.tgz)* which is the most recent version.  Always the previous sentence will indicate (and link to) most recent version. Older versions are no longer compatible with NCBI requirements.

If instead you with to examine the source code or build your own ARBitrator, then please clone the repository and see [Build_ARBitrator/README](Build_ARBitrator/README).
